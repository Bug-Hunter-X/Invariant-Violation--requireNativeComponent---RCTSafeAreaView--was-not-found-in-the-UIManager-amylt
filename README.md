# Expo Invariant Violation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using SafeAreaView in Expo applications. The error, "Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTSafeAreaView" was not found in the UIManager," typically occurs when the necessary native module for SafeAreaView is not properly linked or configured.

## Problem

The `SafeAreaView` component, while seemingly standard, can cause this issue if not correctly set up within the Expo environment.  This often happens when upgrading Expo versions, installing new packages, or working on projects with complex dependency structures.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `react-native-safe-area-context` package is correctly installed and linked. The sample code provides a functional and improved version.
